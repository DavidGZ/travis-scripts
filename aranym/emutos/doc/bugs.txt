AES/VDI/Line-A bugs:
- The right side of outline characters are clipped e.g. in "LaserChess",
  "Diamond miner" & "Minigolf" games, and in vditext tester:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/emutos/mailman/message/29276993/
  This is due to a bug somewhere in the ugly text_blt() assembler
  function in vdi_tblit.S.

Video problems:

Atari Falcon / TOS v4 compatibility bugs:
- Escape Paint icons don't show in image operations window and their
  place in toolbar window is inverted on mouse click.
- Falcon FalcAMP button icons aren't visible as EmuTOS doesn't support
  new style RSC files with CICONs.
- Videl Inside causes a desktop crash if a resolution is selected that
  requires more than the standard EmuTOS Falcon video memory allocation
  (307200 bytes).  It should be able to detect or avoid this situation
  but does not.

Problems that also occur in Atari TOS:
- BIOS: Startup time can be slow on a floppy-only system.  You can speed
  things up by ensuring that you have a formatted floppy diskette in
  drive A at boot time.  Boot time will be further reduced if the root
  directory of the diskette contains as few files as possible, and there
  are no "deleted file" entries in it.  This can be achieved by freshly
  formatting the diskette and then copying any desired files to it.
- VDI: when drawing a wide polyline with squared ends and more than one
  segment, if the width of the line is greater than twice the length of
  an ending segment, the end will have a bump rather than being square.
  This is because wideline segments are joined by using filled circles
  whose radius is half the width of the line: the bump is a protruding
  part of the circle that joins the end segment to the previous one.
- RAM: Cold boot may not be properly detected on some configurations. This
  may happen if the computer has been switched off and on too quickly.
  In that case, the welcome screen is not displayed.
